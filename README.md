About This Repo
===
This repo creates presentable html boxscores ([example html](http://iannoble.org.uk/d5/scores/1718/bx0101.html)) for every [Dynasty Five](dynastyfive.com) game and also produces accompanying bbcode, containing links to the boxscores, that is posted to the Dynasty Five forum ([example bbcode](http://dynasty5ive.proboards.com/post/74113)).  

The repo uses the 'dbf' Python module to read from Dynasty Five's server databases, in 'dbase' dbf format, to represent all player and team information.
